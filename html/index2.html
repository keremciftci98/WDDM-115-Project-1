      During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. appoints physicist J.
      Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project.
      Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing
      the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they
      witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course
      of history.
